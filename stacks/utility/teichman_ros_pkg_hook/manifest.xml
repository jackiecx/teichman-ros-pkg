  <description brief="teichman_ros_pkg_hook">

    This is a placeholder package which all teichman-ros-pkg packages depend on.  Mainly you would care about this if you are using teichman-ros-pkg as an external repository that is automatically retrieved and built by your own repository. In this case, if pkgA depends on eigen_extensions, and you rosmake pkgA, you want teichman-ros-pkg to automatically get updated if necessary.  Replacing this package with a custom Makefile can help.
